## Projects
### Campus Information Query Engine: Nov 2023
- Led the successful development of a dynamic TypeScript project, employing an Agile 
methodology with iterative sprints and weekly scrum ceremonies with team members.
- Used libraries to read and parse JSON and HTML files for relevant campus information to craft 
datasets from the user and perform queries on them.
- Developed RESTful API endpoints for the web server and frontend, securing data integrity with 
HTTPS requests.
- Built a thorough testing suite, including black box, white box, mutation tests, and unit tests, 
ensuring robust code quality.

### Data Analysis Projects: Mar 2022
- For the following analyses, parsed information using web scraping to generate the data set and 
then selecting the useful columns and filtering and cleaning them into the target and usable 
data using the R library Tidyverse.
#### Tennis Rankings Analysis:
- Used R to measure the relation between Tennis Player Rank and Prize Money using KNN 
regression and using cross validation to choose K
- Generated a predictions model with R2 = 90 for predicting the Prize Money given the 
player‚Äôs Rank.
#### Smoker Proportions Analysis:
- Conducted a Hypothesis Test using p-values and confidence intervals in R to generate and 
plot a bootstrap distribution for the difference between the proportions of high-school 
smoking students in Canada

### Zone Chasing Game: Jan 2022
- Created a single player game ‚ÄúZone Chaser‚Äù in Java using Object Oriented Programming (OOP) 
with a Graphical User Interface using the Java Swing library.
- Implemented a saving and loading feature for the player using data persistence with JSON.
- Built the game alongside a test suite for every method implemented in the project, minimizing 
unforeseen bugs and glitches.
- Made quick animations to convey game information such as level, points and player state.
- Added a Console Log to record when and how an object‚Äôs state was changed to track down bugs

### Generative Math Quizzer: Jan 2021
- Developed a program in Java that automatically generates and grades math questions of varying 
types and difficulties for students to answer.
- Designed a prototype following the client‚Äôs requirements with a program flowchart for the client 
to give feedback on and approve before final version was designed. 
- Stored answers and student data in a relational database management system that can be 
accessed by teachers using MySQL. 
- Created a password protected login system for the teachers to keep track of individual student 
progress and class averages.
