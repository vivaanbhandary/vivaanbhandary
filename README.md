## Projects
### SavourSafe ‚Äì Food Recommender System (YouCode 2024 Hackathon Project)	Apr 2024 - Present
-	Pioneered a hybrid Python and JavaScript application focusing on Machine Learning to predict user food preferences, using predictive analytics.
-	Implemented Linear Regression to accurately forecast user preferences by minimizing the difference between actual and predicted ratings.
-	Plan to integrate Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to increase efficiency and interpretability. Additionally, aiming to develop RESTful API endpoints for backend integration for multi-platform deployment.


### Campus Information Query Engine: Nov 2023
-	Led the successful development of a TypeScript project, employing Agile methodologies with iterative sprints and weekly scrum meetings with team members.
-	Integrated libraries for parsing JSON and HTML files hosting campus information, to create datasets for complex query operations. 
-	Developed RESTful API endpoints between the web server and frontend, prioritizing security with HTTPS encryption.
-	Built a thorough testing suite, involving black box, white box, mutation, and unit tests, ensuring robust code quality.


### Data Analysis Projects: Mar 2022
- **Data Preparation:** Utilized web scraping techniques to extract datasets, employing the R-Tidyverse library for data selection, filtering, and cleaning to prepare analysis-ready datasets.
  
#### Tennis Rankings Analysis:
-	Applied KNN regression in R to analyze the correlation between Tennis Player Rank and Prize Money, optimizing model parameters using cross-validation.
-	Developed a predictions model with R2 = 0.9 to predict Prize Money given a player‚Äôs Rank.

#### Smoker Proportions Analysis:
- Conducted a Hypothesis Test using p-values and confidence intervals in R to generate and plot a bootstrap distribution for the difference between the proportions of high-school smoking students in different provinces in Canada.

### Zone Chasing Game: Jan 2022
-	Created a single player game ‚ÄúZone Chaser‚Äù in Java using OOP and the Java Swing library for a robust GUI.
-	Implemented game state saving and loading for the player using data persistence with JSON.
-	Built a comprehensive test suite, ensuring high code quality and minimizing gameplay bugs.
-	Made smooth animations to display game-info like level, points, and player state.
-	Added a Console Log to monitor and record object state changes for streamlined bug tracking.


### Generative Math Quizzer: Jan 2021
-	Crafted a Java application that automatically generates and evaluates math questions of various types for students to answer.
-	Designed detailed prototypes based on client specifications using a program flowchart for an iterative feedback and approval loop. 
-	Stored test and student data in a relational database management system (RDBMS) using MySQL that can be accessed by teachers from a password protected login system.


## Education
